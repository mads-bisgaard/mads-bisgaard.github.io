## Welcome to my website

Since September 2019 I'm an optimization software developer at [Embotech AG](https://www.embotech.com/). That means I spend a lot of time developing software for doing embedded optimization. Before that I did my PhD in mathematics at the ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

I have many interests and the plan is for this website to be a place where I can share what I am doing.

Generally, I am very interested in dynamics and how one can develop software tools to interact with real-world dynamical systems. That is something which used to be an academic dicipline but which is moving more and more into industry. I think that's a great thing!

### Optimization, Control and Statistics

Working in optimization and real-time control, one of the things I am very interested in is how to ensure/verify/certify that a control algorithm is safe to deploy. I have been thinking a lot about this topic and recently put the following paper on the arXiv

- (joint with A. Domahidi). A risk analysis framework for real-time control systems. [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12225)

### Pure mathematics

In a previous life I worked in symplectic topology. That's a field within pure mathematics which studies the geometry of Hamiltonian systems (think of celestial mechanics). I loved the work but eventually lost interest in the topic. During my PhD I wrote the following papers.

- Mather theory and symplectic rigidity. [Journal of Modern Dynamics 15 (2019), 165-207](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/jmd.2019018)
- Topology of (small) Lagrangian cobordisms. [Algebraic & Geometric Topology 19-2 (2019), 701-742](https://msp.org/agt/2019/19-2/p03.xhtml)
- A distance expanding flow on exact Lagrangian cobordism classes.[arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05821)
- Invariants of Lagrangian cobordisms via spectral numbers. [Journal of Topology and Analysis Vol 11, No. 01, 2019](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793525319500092)

For this work I was awarded the [ETH medal](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/awards/eth-medal.html) in 2019. Preprints of all of these papers are also available through the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Bisgaard%2C+M+R). If you are interested in this kind of stuff you can watch a talk on [an introduction to Aubry Mather theory](http://www.msri.org/summer_schools/825/schedules/24331) as well as one on [symplectic Mather theory](http://www.msri.org/summer_schools/825/schedules/24314) which I gave at an MSRI summer school.
