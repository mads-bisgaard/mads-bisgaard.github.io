## Welcome to my website

I'm an optimization software developer at [Embotech AG](https://www.embotech.com/). That means I spend a lot of time developing software for doing embedded optimization. I am very interested in dynamics and how one can develop software tools to control dynamical systems. That is something which used to be an academic dicipline but which is moving more and more into industry. I think that's a great thing!

### Mathematics

In a former life I worked in symplectic topology. That's a field within pure mathematics which studies the geometry of Hamiltonian systems (think of celestial mechanics). During my PhD I published the following papers.

- Mather theory and symplectic rigidity. [Journal of Modern Dynamics 15 (2019), 165-207](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/jmd.2019018)
- Topology of (small) Lagrangian cobordisms. [Algebraic & Geometric Topology 19-2 (2019), 701-742](https://msp.org/agt/2019/19-2/p03.xhtml)
- [A distance expanding flow on exact Lagrangian cobordism classes.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05821)
- Invariants of Lagrangian cobordisms via spectral numbers. [Journal of Topology and Analysis Vol 11, No. 01, 2019](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S1793525319500092)

Preprints of all of these are also available through the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&query=Bisgaard%2C+M+R).
