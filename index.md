### Mathematics

In a former life I worked in symplectic topology. That's a field within pure mathematics which studies the geometry of Hamiltonian systems (think of the celestial mechanics). During my PhD I managed to produce the following papers.

- Mather theory and symplectic rigidity. [Journal of Modern Dynamics 15 (2019), 165-207](https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/jmd.2019018)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mads-bisgaard/mads-bisgaard.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
