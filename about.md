Since September 2019 I work on embedded optimization for real-time control systems at [Embotech AG](https://www.embotech.com/). That means I spend a lot of time developing high performance numerical optimization software. Before that I did my PhD in mathematics at the ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

Generally, I am very interested in dynamics and how one can develop software tools to interact with real-world dynamical systems. That is something which used to be an academic dicipline but which is moving more and more into industry. I think that's a great thing!
