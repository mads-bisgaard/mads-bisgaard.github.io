# Software

Here are some of the different software projects I have worked on:

[RPiCamGui](https://github.com/mads-bisgaard/RPiCamGui) is a simple GUI designed for controlling the [Raspberry Pi High Quality camera](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/) remotely. It only requires an ssh connection to the Raspberry Pi where it calls *raspistill*. 

[Monitor](https://github.com/mads-bisgaard/Monitor) is a simple python script for monitoring websites. I have found this useful in the past eg when looking for flats or looking for jobs.
